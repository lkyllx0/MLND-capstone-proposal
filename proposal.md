## Proposal

### Domain Background

Predicting the stock price has been researched for long. Now many people try to predict with the machine learning algorithms, but there is not a single answer for this and it is still challenging problem.

It is also known that every country's stock market influences each other. So putting the another country's stock market price and predicting the stock price index worth challenging.

### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to predict the change rate of the close price of Nikkei 225 index compared to the previous day. Nikkei 225 is a stock market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Japan. 

My hypothesis is that the Nikkei 225 has a strong correlation with the close price of US stock prices (NASDAQ index) and JPY/USD foreign exchange rate of the previous day.

The target variable is the Nikkei 225's relative change rate from the previous day.
For example, in case the Nikkei 225 index close price is "21450.04" and it was "21374.66" at the previous day, the relative change rate is ("21450.04" / "21374.66" ) â‰’ 1.00352.
Then, it is possible to know the error between the predicted rate and the actual rate.

### Datasets and Inputs

The data sets has a long history data. 
I plan to use the data from 2003 to 2016 to train the model.

But I am going to input only the data within some N days.
If the N = 10 days, I am going to input the N days history as a feature data.

#### 1. Nikkei 225 

The data starts from January 1950 to current date. This data can be obtained at Quandl.
- https://www.quandl.com/data/NIKKEI/INDEX-Nikkei-Index

The input feature data is the change from the previous day.

#### 2. NASDAQ Index

The data starts from January 2003 to current date. This data can be obtained at Quandl.
- https://www.quandl.com/data/NASDAQOMX/COMP-NASDAQ-Composite-COMP

The input feature data is the change from the previous day of the NASDAQ index.

#### 3. Currency Exchange - JPY/USD

The data starts from March 1991 to current date. This data can be obtained at Quandl.
- https://www.quandl.com/data/CURRFX/USDJPY-Currency-Exchange-Rates-USD-vs-JPY

The input feature data is the change from the previous day of the JPY/USD exchange rate.

### Solution Statement

The solution to this problem is to apply LSTM (Long short-term memory) to predict the Nikkei 225 index of the next day. LSTM is a one kind of the RNN (Recurrent neural network).
I chose LSTM for this problem because: 
- this is a type of time-series problem.
- LSTM has the advantages that can remember the past values better.

I will input the data of input_size: N, which means the data within N days will be input as a feature data.
So inputting the N days data of the change rate for Nikkei 225, NASDAQ and JPY/USD exchange rate, I am going to predict the change rate of Nikkei 225.

About proprocessing the data, all of the input data are change rate so I think no need to normalize them. 

### Benchmark Model

I'd like to use the MAPE (Mean absolute percentage error) to evaluate the prediction.
Benchmark model is MAPE calculated using using the [DummyClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier.html).

### Evaluation Metrics

My prediction model calculates the change rate, so I think MAPE (Mean absolute percentage error) would be good choice to evaluate the model.

### Project Design

#### Data preprocessing

The first step is collecting the data. As discussed above, I will obtain the data from Quandl. 
The file is CSV and the data is numeric value. But the value among them, it is different value so I need to normalize them.

I will split the data for training dataset is within 2003 to 2015, validation dataset is 2016, test dataset is 2017 (Until current date). 

#### Model 

The second step is to build the model with LSTM.
I am planning to start with the simple model first, which is input_size: 10 days. 
After seeing the result, I am going to adjust the parameters and try to get the best result.
